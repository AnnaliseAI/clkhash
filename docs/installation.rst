Installation
============


Install ``clkhash`` with all dependencies using pip:

::

    pip install clkhash


If the installation of ``bitarray`` fails on Windows you may need to install the appropriate
[Visual Studio C++ compiler](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers) for your version
of Python; this is required because the `bitarray` library compiles a C extension.
